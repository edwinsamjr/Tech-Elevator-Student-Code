            <blockquote>"What the hell? How could the install not find the drive? I had no idea what driver to load. I
                wasn’t sure what the problem was."</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"This week I made the jump into the world of blogging. I decided that the easiest way to get
                started would be to register with blogger.com and might as well register a domain also."</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"I attended the Microsoft //build/ conference last week. This was the public world’s second
                introduction to the next version of company’s OS, Windows 8. It was also the first time that any real
                depth about the product was provided. The general consensus from those I spoke with was they were very
                pleased with the features shown."</blockquote>
